== !ArduPlane Parameters ==


=== Eeprom format version number (!ArduPlane:FORMAT_VERSION) ===

_This value is incremented when changes are made to the eeprom format_


=== Software Type (!ArduPlane:SYSID_SW_TYPE) ===

_This is used by the ground station to recognise the software type (eg ArduPlane vs ArduCopter)_


=== MAVLink system ID (!ArduPlane:SYSID_THISMAV) ===

_The identifier of this device in the MAVLink protocol_
 * Range: 1 255


=== Ground station MAVLink system ID (!ArduPlane:SYSID_MYGCS) ===

_The identifier of the ground station in the MAVLink protocol. Don't change this unless you also modify the ground station to match._
 * Range: 1 255


=== CLI Enable (!ArduPlane:CLI_ENABLED) ===

_This enables`/`disables the checking for three carriage returns on telemetry links on startup to enter the diagnostics command line interface_
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Autotune level (!ArduPlane:AUTOTUNE_LEVEL) ===

_Level of agressiveness for autotune. When autotune is run a lower AUTOTUNE`_`LEVEL will result in a 'softer' tune, with less agressive gains. For most users a level of 6 is recommended._
 * Range: 1 10
 * Increment: 1


=== Telemetry startup delay  (!ArduPlane:TELEM_DELAY) ===

_The amount of time (in seconds) to delay radio telemetry to prevent an Xbee bricking on power up_
 * Range: 0 10
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: seconds


=== Rudder Mix (!ArduPlane:KFF_RDDRMIX) ===

_The amount of rudder mix to apply during aileron movement 0 `=` 0 %, 1 `=` 100%_
 * Range: 0 1
 * Increment: 0.01


=== Throttle to Pitch Mix (!ArduPlane:KFF_THR2PTCH) ===

_Throttle to pitch feed-forward gain._
 * Range: 0 5
 * Increment: 0.01


=== Low throttle pitch down trim  (!ArduPlane:STAB_PITCH_DOWN) ===

_This controls the amount of down pitch to add in FBWA and AUTOTUNE modes when at low throttle. No down trim is added when throttle is above TRIM`_`THROTTLE. Below TRIM`_`THROTTLE downtrim is added in proportion to the amount the throttle is below TRIM`_`THROTTLE. At zero throttle the full downpitch specified in this parameter is added. This parameter is meant to help keep airspeed up when flying in FBWA mode with low throttle, such as when on a landing approach, without relying on an airspeed sensor. A value of 2 degrees is good for many planes, although a higher value may be needed for high drag aircraft._
 * Range: 0 15
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: Degrees


=== Glide slope minimum (!ArduPlane:GLIDE_SLOPE_MIN) ===

_This controls the minimum altitude change for a waypoint before a glide slope will be used instead of an immediate altitude change. The default value is 15 meters, which helps to smooth out waypoint missions where small altitude changes happen near waypoints. If you don't want glide slopes to be used in missions then you can set this to zero, which will disable glide slope calculations. Otherwise you can set it to a minimum number of meters of altitude error to the destination waypoint before a glide slope will be used to change altitude._
 * Range: 0 1000
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: meters


=== Glide slope threshold (!ArduPlane:GLIDE_SLOPE_THR) ===

_This controls the height above the glide slope the plane may be before rebuilding a glide slope. This is useful for smoothing out an autotakeoff_
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: meters


=== Stick Mixing (!ArduPlane:STICK_MIXING) ===

_When enabled, this adds user stick input to the control surfaces in auto modes, allowing the user to have some degree of flight control without changing modes.  There are two types of stick mixing available. If you set STICK`_`MIXING to 1 then it will use "fly by wire" mixing, which controls the roll and pitch in the same way that the FBWA mode does. This is the safest option if you usually fly ArduPlane in FBWA or FBWB mode. If you set STICK`_`MIXING to 2 then it will enable direct mixing mode, which is what the STABILIZE mode uses. That will allow for much more extreme maneuvers while in AUTO mode._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || FBWMixing ||
|| 2 || !DirectMixing ||


=== Skip gyro calibration (!ArduPlane:SKIP_GYRO_CAL) ===

_When enabled this tells the APM to skip the normal gyroscope calibration at startup, and instead use the saved gyro calibration from the last flight. You should only enable this if you are careful to check that your aircraft has good attitude control before flying, as some boards may have significantly different gyro calibration between boots, especially if the temperature changes a lot. If gyro calibration is skipped then APM relies on using the gyro drift detection code to get the right gyro calibration in the few minutes after it boots. This option is mostly useful where the requirement to hold the plane still while it is booting is a significant problem._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Use FBWA steering in AUTO (!ArduPlane:AUTO_FBW_STEER) ===

_When enabled this option gives FBWA navigation and steering in AUTO mode. This can be used to allow manual stabilised piloting with waypoint logic for triggering payloads. With this enabled the pilot has the same control over the plane as in FBWA mode, and the normal AUTO navigation is completely disabled. This option is not recommended for normal use._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Takeoff throttle min speed (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_THR_MINSPD) ===

_Minimum GPS ground speed in m`/`s used by the speed check that un-suppresses throttle in auto-takeoff. This can be be used for catapult launches where you want the motor to engage only after the plane leaves the catapult, but it is preferable to use the TKOFF`_`THR`_`MINACC and TKOFF`_`THR`_`DELAY parameters for catapult launches due to the errors associated with GPS measurements. For hand launches with a pusher prop it is strongly advised that this parameter be set to a value no less than 4 m`/`s to provide additional protection against premature motor start. Note that the GPS velocity will lag the real velocity by about 0.5 seconds. The ground speed check is delayed by the TKOFF`_`THR`_`DELAY parameter._
 * Range: 0 30
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: m`/`s


=== Takeoff throttle min acceleration (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_THR_MINACC) ===

_Minimum forward acceleration in m`/`s`/`s before arming the ground speed check in auto-takeoff. This is meant to be used for hand launches. Setting this value to 0 disables the acceleration test which means the ground speed check will always be armed which could allow GPS velocity jumps to start the engine. For hand launches and bungee launches this should be set to around 15._
 * Range: 0 30
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: m`/`s`/`s


=== Takeoff throttle delay (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_THR_DELAY) ===

_This parameter sets the time delay (in 1`/`10ths of a second) that the ground speed check is delayed after the forward acceleration check controlled by TKOFF`_`THR`_`MINACC has passed. For hand launches with pusher propellers it is essential that this is set to a value of no less than 2 (0.2 seconds) to ensure that the aircraft is safely clear of the throwers arm before the motor can start. For bungee launches a larger value can be used (such as 30) to give time for the bungee to release from the aircraft before the motor is started._
 * Range: 0 127
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: 0.1 seconds


=== Takeoff tail dragger elevator (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_TDRAG_ELEV) ===

_This parameter sets the amount of elevator to apply during the initial stage of a takeoff. It is used to hold the tail wheel of a taildragger on the ground during the initial takeoff stage to give maximum steering. This option should be conbined with the TKOFF`_`TDRAG`_`SPD1 option and the GROUND`_`STEER`_`ALT option along with tuning of the ground steering controller. A value of zero means to bypass the initial "tail hold" stage of takeoff. Set to zero for hand and catapult launch. For tail-draggers you should normally set this to 100, meaning full up elevator during the initial stage of takeoff. For most tricycle undercarriage aircraft a value of zero will work well, but for some tricycle aircraft a small negative value (say around -20 to -30) will apply down elevator which will hold the nose wheel firmly on the ground during initial acceleration. Only use a negative value if you find that the nosewheel doesn't grip well during takeoff. Too much down elevator on a tricycle undercarriage may cause instability in steering as the plane pivots around the nosewheel. Add down elevator 10 percent at a time._
 * Range: -100 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Takeoff tail dragger speed1 (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_TDRAG_SPD1) ===

_This parameter sets the airspeed at which to stop holding the tail down and transition to rudder control of steering on the ground. When TKOFF`_`TDRAG`_`SPD1 is reached the pitch of the aircraft will be held level until TKOFF`_`ROTATE`_`SPD is reached, at which point the takeoff pitch specified in the mission will be used to "rotate" the pitch for takeoff climb. Set TKOFF`_`TDRAG`_`SPD1 to zero to go straight to rotation. This should be set to zero for hand launch and catapult launch. It should also be set to zero for tricycle undercarriages. For tail dragger aircraft it should be set just below the stall speed._
 * Range: 0 30
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: m`/`s


=== Takeoff rotate speed (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_ROTATE_SPD) ===

_This parameter sets the airspeed at which the aircraft will "rotate", setting climb pitch specified in the mission. If TKOFF`_`ROTATE`_`SPD is zero then the climb pitch will be used as soon as takeoff is started. For hand launch and catapult launches a TKOFF`_`ROTATE`_`SPD of zero should be set. For all ground launches TKOFF`_`ROTATE`_`SPD should be set above the stall speed, usually by about 10 to 30 percent_
 * Range: 0 30
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: m`/`s


=== Takeoff throttle slew rate (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_THR_SLEW) ===

_This parameter sets the slew rate for the throttle during auto takeoff. When this is zero the THR`_`SLEWRATE parameter is used during takeoff. For rolling takeoffs it can be a good idea to set a lower slewrate for takeoff to give a slower acceleration which can improve ground steering control. The value is a percentage throttle change per second, so a value of 20 means to advance the throttle over 5 seconds on takeoff. Values below 20 are not recommended as they may cause the plane to try to climb out with too little throttle._
 * Range: 0 127
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: percent


=== Takeoff flap percentage (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_FLAP_PCNT) ===

_The amount of flaps (as a percentage) to apply in automatic takeoff_
 * Range: 0 100
 * Units: Percent


=== FBWA taildragger channel (!ArduPlane:FBWA_TDRAG_CHAN) ===

_This is a RC input channel which when it goes above 1700 enables FBWA taildragger takeoff mode. It should be assigned to a momentary switch. Once this feature is enabled it will stay enabled until the aircraft goes above TKOFF`_`TDRAG`_`SPD1 airspeed, changes mode, or the pitch goes above the initial pitch when this is engaged or goes below 0 pitch. When enabled the elevator will be forced to TKOFF`_`TDRAG`_`ELEV. This option allows for easier takeoffs on taildraggers in FBWA mode, and also makes it easier to test auto-takeoff steering handling in FBWA. Setting it to 0 disables this option._


=== Level flight roll limit (!ArduPlane:LEVEL_ROLL_LIMIT) ===

_This controls the maximum bank angle in degrees during flight modes where level flight is desired, such as in the final stages of landing, and during auto takeoff. This should be a small angle (such as 5 degrees) to prevent a wing hitting the runway during takeoff or landing. Setting this to zero will completely disable heading hold on auto takeoff and final landing approach._
 * Range: 0 45
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: degrees


=== Landing Pitch (!ArduPlane:LAND_PITCH_CD) ===

_Used in autoland to give the minimum pitch in the final stage of landing (after the flare). This parameter can be used to ensure that the final landing attitude is appropriate for the type of undercarriage on the aircraft. Note that it is a minimum pitch only - the landing code will control pitch above this value to try to achieve the configured landing sink rate._
 * Units: centi-Degrees


=== Landing flare altitude (!ArduPlane:LAND_FLARE_ALT) ===

_Altitude in autoland at which to lock heading and flare to the LAND`_`PITCH`_`CD pitch. Note that this option is secondary to LAND`_`FLARE`_`SEC. For a good landing it preferable that the flare is triggered by LAND`_`FLARE`_`SEC. _
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: meters


=== Landing flare time (!ArduPlane:LAND_FLARE_SEC) ===

_Vertical time before landing point at which to lock heading and flare with the motor stopped. This is vertical time, and is calculated based solely on the current height above the ground and the current descent rate.  Set to 0 if you only wish to flare based on altitude (see LAND`_`FLARE`_`ALT)._
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: seconds


=== Landing disarm delay (!ArduPlane:LAND_DISARMDELAY) ===

_After a landing has completed using a LAND waypoint, automatically disarm after this many seconds have passed. Use 0 to not disarm._
 * Range: 0 127
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: seconds


=== Navigation controller selection (!ArduPlane:NAV_CONTROLLER) ===

_Which navigation controller to enable. Currently the only navigation controller available is L1. From time to time other experimental conrtrollers will be added which are selected using this parameter._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Default ||
|| 1 || L1Controller ||


=== GPS to Baro Mix (!ArduPlane:ALT_MIX) ===

_The percent of mixing between GPS altitude and baro altitude. 0 `=` 100% gps, 1 `=` 100% baro. It is highly recommend that you not change this from the default of 1, as GPS altitude is notoriously unreliable. The only time I would recommend changing this is if you have a high altitude enabled GPS, and you are dropping a plane from a high altitude baloon many kilometers off the ground._
 * Range: 0 1
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: Percent


=== Altitude control algorithm (!ArduPlane:ALT_CTRL_ALG) ===

_This sets what algorithm will be used for altitude control. The default is zero, which selects the most appropriate algorithm for your airframe. Currently the default is to use TECS (total energy control system). From time to time we will add other experimental altitude control algorithms which will be seleted using this parameter._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Automatic ||


=== Altitude offset (!ArduPlane:ALT_OFFSET) ===

_This is added to the target altitude in automatic flight. It can be used to add a global altitude offset to a mission_
 * Range: -32767 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Meters


=== Waypoint Radius (!ArduPlane:WP_RADIUS) ===

_Defines the maximum distance from a waypoint that when crossed indicates the waypoint may be complete. To avoid the aircraft looping around the waypoint in case it misses by more than the WP`_`RADIUS an additional check is made to see if the aircraft has crossed a "finish line" passing through the waypoint and perpendicular to the flight path from the previous waypoint. If that finish line is crossed then the waypoint is considered complete. Note that the navigation controller may decide to turn later than WP`_`RADIUS before a waypoint, based on how sharp the turn is and the speed of the aircraft. It is safe to set WP`_`RADIUS much larger than the usual turn radius of your aircaft and the navigation controller will work out when to turn. If you set WP`_`RADIUS too small then you will tend to overshoot the turns._
 * Range: 1 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Meters


=== Waypoint Maximum Radius (!ArduPlane:WP_MAX_RADIUS) ===

_Sets the maximum distance to a waypoint for the waypoint to be considered complete. This overrides the "cross the finish line" logic that is normally used to consider a waypoint complete. For normal AUTO behaviour this parameter should be set to zero. Using a non-zero value is only recommended when it is critical that the aircraft does approach within the given radius, and should loop around until it has done so. This can cause the aircraft to loop forever if its turn radius is greater than the maximum radius set._
 * Range: 0 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Meters


=== Waypoint Loiter Radius (!ArduPlane:WP_LOITER_RAD) ===

_Defines the distance from the waypoint center, the plane will maintain during a loiter. If you set this value to a negative number then the default loiter direction will be counter-clockwise instead of clockwise._
 * Range: -32767 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Meters


=== Action on geofence breach (!ArduPlane:FENCE_ACTION) ===

_What to do on fence breach. If this is set to 0 then no action is taken, and geofencing is disabled. If this is set to 1 then the plane will enter GUIDED mode, with the target waypoint as the fence return point. If this is set to 2 then the fence breach is reported to the ground station, but no other action is taken. If set to 3 then the plane enters guided mode but the pilot retains manual throttle control._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || None ||
|| 1 || !GuidedMode ||
|| 2 || !ReportOnly ||
|| 3 || !GuidedModeThrPass ||


=== Fence Total (!ArduPlane:FENCE_TOTAL) ===

_Number of geofence points currently loaded_


=== Fence Channel (!ArduPlane:FENCE_CHANNEL) ===

_RC Channel to use to enable geofence. PWM input above 1750 enables the geofence_


=== Fence Minimum Altitude (!ArduPlane:FENCE_MINALT) ===

_Minimum altitude allowed before geofence triggers_
 * Range: 0 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: meters


=== Fence Maximum Altitude (!ArduPlane:FENCE_MAXALT) ===

_Maximum altitude allowed before geofence triggers_
 * Range: 0 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: meters


=== Fence Return Altitude (!ArduPlane:FENCE_RETALT) ===

_Altitude the aircraft will transit to when a fence breach occurs.  If FENCE`_`RETALT is `<``=` 0 then the midpoint between FENCE`_`MAXALT and FENCE`_`MINALT is used, unless FENCE`_`MAXALT `<` FENCE`_`MINALT.  If FENCE`_`MAXALT `<` FENCE`_`MINALT AND FENCE`_`RETALT is `<``=` 0 then ALT`_`HOLD`_`RTL is the altitude used on a fence breach._
 * Range: 0 32767
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: meters


=== Fence automatic enable (!ArduPlane:FENCE_AUTOENABLE) ===

_When set to 1, gefence automatically enables after an auto takeoff and automatically disables at the beginning of an auto landing.  When on the ground before takeoff the fence is disabled. It is highly recommended to not use this option for line of sight flying and use a fence enable channel instead._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || !NoAutoEnable ||
|| 1 || !AutoEnable ||


=== Fence Return to Rally (!ArduPlane:FENCE_RET_RALLY) ===

_When set to 1: on fence breach the plane will return to the nearest rally point rather than the fence return point.  If no rally points have been defined the plane will return to the home point.  _
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || !FenceReturnPoint ||
|| 1 || !NearestRallyPoint ||


=== Enable stall prevention (!ArduPlane:STALL_PREVENTION) ===

_This controls the use of stall prevention techniques, including roll limits at low speed and raising the minimum airspeed in turns. The limits are based on the aerodynamic load factor of a banked turn. This option relies on the correct ARSPD`_`FBW`_`MIN value being set correctly. Note that if you don't have an airspeed sensor then stall prevention will use an airspeed estimate based on the ground speed plus a wind estimate taken from the response of the autopilot banked turns. That synthetic airspeed estimate may be inaccurate, so you should not assume that stall prevention with no airspeed sensor will be effective._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Minimum Airspeed (!ArduPlane:ARSPD_FBW_MIN) ===

_This is the minimum airspeed you want to fly at in modes where the autopilot controls the airspeed. This should be set to a value around 20% higher than the level flight stall speed for the airframe. This value is also used in the STALL`_`PREVENTION code._
 * Range: 5 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: m`/`s


=== Maximum Airspeed (!ArduPlane:ARSPD_FBW_MAX) ===

_This is the maximum airspeed that you want to allow for your airframe in auto-throttle modes. You should ensure that this value is sufficiently above the ARSPD`_`FBW`_`MIN value to allow for a sufficient flight envelope to accurately control altitude using airspeed. A value at least 50% above ARSPD`_`FBW`_`MIN is recommended._
 * Range: 5 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: m`/`s


=== Fly By Wire elevator reverse (!ArduPlane:FBWB_ELEV_REV) ===

_Reverse sense of elevator in FBWB and CRUISE modes. When set to 0 up elevator (pulling back on the stick) means to lower altitude. When set to 1, up elevator means to raise altitude._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Use terrain following (!ArduPlane:TERRAIN_FOLLOW) ===

_This enables terrain following for CRUISE mode, FBWB mode, RTL and for rally points. To use this option you also need to set TERRAIN`_`ENABLE to 1, which enables terrain data fetching from the GCS, and you need to have a GCS that supports sending terrain data to the aircraft. When terrain following is enabled then CRUISE and FBWB mode will hold height above terrain rather than height above home. In RTL the return to launch altitude will be considered to be a height above the terrain. Rally point altitudes will be taken as height above the terrain. This option does not affect mission items, which have a per-waypoint flag for whether they are height above home or height above the terrain. To use terrain following missions you need a ground station which can set the waypoint type to be a terrain height waypoint when creating the mission._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Terrain lookahead (!ArduPlane:TERRAIN_LOOKAHD) ===

_This controls how far ahead the terrain following code looks to ensure it stays above upcoming terrain. A value of zero means no lookahead, so the controller will track only the terrain directly below the aircraft. The lookahead will never extend beyond the next waypoint when in AUTO mode._
 * Range: 0 10000
 * Units: meters


=== Fly By Wire B altitude change rate (!ArduPlane:FBWB_CLIMB_RATE) ===

_This sets the rate in m`/`s at which FBWB and CRUISE modes will change its target altitude for full elevator deflection. Note that the actual climb rate of the aircraft can be lower than this, depending on your airspeed and throttle control settings. If you have this parameter set to the default value of 2.0, then holding the elevator at maximum deflection for 10 seconds would change the target altitude by 20 meters._
 * Range: 1-10
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Minimum Throttle (!ArduPlane:THR_MIN) ===

_The minimum throttle setting (as a percentage) which the autopilot will apply. For the final stage of an automatic landing this is always zero._
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Maximum Throttle (!ArduPlane:THR_MAX) ===

_The maximum throttle setting (as a percentage) which the autopilot will apply._
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Maximum Throttle for takeoff (!ArduPlane:TKOFF_THR_MAX) ===

_The maximum throttle setting during automatic takeoff. If this is zero then THR`_`MAX is used for takeoff as well._
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Throttle slew rate (!ArduPlane:THR_SLEWRATE) ===

_maximum percentage change in throttle per second. A setting of 10 means to not change the throttle by more than 10% of the full throttle range in one second._
 * Range: 0 127
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Flap slew rate (!ArduPlane:FLAP_SLEWRATE) ===

_maximum percentage change in flap output per second. A setting of 25 means to not change the flap by more than 25% of the full flap range in one second. A value of 0 means no rate limiting._
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Throttle suppress manual passthru (!ArduPlane:THR_SUPP_MAN) ===

_When throttle is supressed in auto mode it is normally forced to zero. If you enable this option, then while suppressed it will be manual throttle. This is useful on petrol engines to hold the idle throttle manually while waiting for takeoff_
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Throttle passthru in stabilize (!ArduPlane:THR_PASS_STAB) ===

_If this is set then when in STABILIZE, FBWA or ACRO modes the throttle is a direct passthru from the transmitter. This means the THR`_`MIN and THR`_`MAX settings are not used in these modes. This is useful for petrol engines where you setup a throttle cut switch that suppresses the throttle below the normal minimum._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Throttle Failsafe Enable (!ArduPlane:THR_FAILSAFE) ===

_The throttle failsafe allows you to configure a software failsafe activated by a setting on the throttle input channel_
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Throttle Failsafe Value (!ArduPlane:THR_FS_VALUE) ===

_The PWM level on channel 3 below which throttle sailsafe triggers_
 * Range: 925 1100
 * Increment: 1


=== Throttle cruise percentage (!ArduPlane:TRIM_THROTTLE) ===

_The target percentage of throttle to apply for normal flight_
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: Percent


=== Throttle nudge enable (!ArduPlane:THROTTLE_NUDGE) ===

_When enabled, this uses the throttle input in auto-throttle modes to 'nudge' the throttle or airspeed to higher or lower values. When you have an airspeed sensor the nudge affects the target airspeed, so that throttle inputs above 50% will increase the target airspeed from TRIM`_`ARSPD`_`CM up to a maximum of ARSPD`_`FBW`_`MAX. When no airspeed sensor is enabled the throttle nudge will push up the target throttle for throttle inputs above 50%._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Disabled ||
|| 1 || Enabled ||


=== Short failsafe action (!ArduPlane:FS_SHORT_ACTN) ===

_The action to take on a short (FS`_`SHORT`_`TIMEOUT) failsafe event. A short failsafe even can be triggered either by loss of RC control (see THR`_`FS`_`VALUE) or by loss of GCS control (see FS`_`GCS`_`ENABL). A short failsafe event in stabilization and manual modes will cause an change to CIRCLE mode if FS`_`SHORT`_`ACTN is 0 or 1, and a change to FBWA mode if FS`_`SHORT`_`ACTN is 2. In all other modes (including AUTO and GUIDED mode) a short failsafe event will cause no mode change is FS`_`SHORT`_`ACTN is set to 0, will cause a change to CIRCLE mode if set to 1 and will change to FBWA mode if set to 2. Please see the documentation for FS`_`LONG`_`ACTN for the behaviour after FS`_`LONG`_`TIMEOUT seconds of failsafe._
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Continue ||
|| 1 || Circle/ReturnToLaunch ||
|| 2 || Glide ||


=== Short failsafe timeout (!ArduPlane:FS_SHORT_TIMEOUT) ===

_The time in seconds that a failsafe condition has to persist before a short failsafe event will occor. This defaults to 1.5 seconds_
 * Range: 1 100
 * Increment: 0.5
 * Units: seconds


=== Long failsafe action (!ArduPlane:FS_LONG_ACTN) ===

_The action to take on a long (FS`_`LONG`_`TIMEOUT seconds) failsafe event. If the aircraft was in a stabilization or manual mode when failsafe started and a long failsafe occurs then it will change to RTL mode if FS`_`LONG`_`ACTN is 0 or 1, and will change to FBWA if FS`_`LONG`_`ACTN is set to 2. If the aircraft was in an auto mode (such as AUTO or GUIDED) when the failsafe started then it will continue in the auto mode if FS`_`LONG`_`ACTN is set to 0, will change to RTL mode if FS`_`LONG`_`ACTN is set to 1 and will change to FBWA mode if FS`_`LONG`_`ACTN is set to 2. _
 * Values 
|| *Value* || *Meaning* ||
|| 0 || Continue ||
|| 1 || !ReturnToLaunch ||
|| 2 || Glide ||


=== Long failsafe timeout (!ArduPlane:FS_LONG_TIMEOUT) ===

_The time in seconds that a failsafe condition has to persist before a long failsafe event will occor. This defaults to 5 seconds_
 * Range: 1 300
 * Increment: 0.5
 * Units: seconds


=== Failsafe battery voltage (!ArduPlane:FS_BATT_VOLTAGE) ===

_Battery voltage to trigger failsafe. Set to 0 to disable battery voltage failsafe. If the battery voltage drops below this voltage continuously for 10 seconds then the plane will switch to RTL mode_
 * Increment: 0.1

_Enable ground control station telemetry failsafe. Failsafe will trigger after FS`_`LONG`_`TIMEOUT seconds of no MAVLink heartbeat messages. There are two possible enabled settings. Seeing FS`_`GCS`_`ENABL to 1 means that GCS failsafe will be triggered when the aircraft has not received a MAVLink HEARTBEAT message. Setting FS`_`GCS`_`ENABL to 2 means that GCS failsafe will be triggerded on either a loss of HEARTBEAT messages, or a RADIO`_`STATUS message from a MAVLink enabled 3DR radio indicating that the ground station is not receiving status updates from the aircraft, which is indicated by the RADIO`_`STATUS.remrssi field being zero (this may happen if you have a one way link due to asymmetric noise on the ground station and aircraft radios). WARNING: Enabling this option opens up the possibility of your plane going into failsafe mode and running the motor on the ground it it loses contact with your ground station. If this option is enabled on an electric plane then you should enable ARMING`_`REQUIRED. _

=== Automatic trim adjustment (!ArduPlane:TRIM_AUTO) ===

_Set RC trim PWM levels to current levels when switching away from manual mode. When this option is enabled and you change from MANUAL to any other mode then the APM will take the current position of the control sticks as the trim values for aileron, elevator and rudder. It will use those to set RC1`_`TRIM, RC2`_`TRIM and RC4`_`TRIM. This option is disabled by default as if a pilot is not aware of this option and changes from MANUAL to another mode while control inputs are not centered then the trim could be changed to a dangerously bad value. You can enable this option to assist with trimming your plane, by enabling it before takeoff then switching briefly to MANUAL in flight, and seeing how the plane reacts. You can then switch back to FBWA, trim the surfaces then again test MANUAL mode. Each time you switch from MANUAL the APM will take your control inputs as the new trim. After you have good trim on your aircraft you can disable TRIM`_`AUTO for future flights._

=== Mixing Gain (!ArduPlane:MIXING_GAIN) ===

_The gain for the Vtail and elevon output mixers. The default is 0.5, which ensures that the mixer doesn't saturate, allowing both input channels to go to extremes while retaining control over the output. Hardware mixers often have a 1.0 gain, which gives more servo throw, but can saturate. If you don't have enough throw on your servos with VTAIL`_`OUTPUT or ELEVON`_`OUTPUT enabled then you can raise the gain using MIXING`_`GAIN. The mixer allows outputs in the range 900 to 2100 microseconds._
 * Range: 0.5 1.2


=== Rudder only aircraft (!ArduPlane:RUDDER_ONLY) ===

_Enable rudder only mode. The rudder will control attitude in attitude controlled modes (such as FBWA). You should setup your transmitter to send roll stick inputs to the RCMAP`_`YAW channel (normally channel 4). The rudder servo should be attached to the RCMAP`_`YAW channel as well. Note that automatic ground steering will be disabled for rudder only aircraft. You should also set KFF`_`RDDRMIX to 1.0. You will also need to setup the YAW2SRV`_`DAMP yaw damping appropriately for your aircraft. A value of 0.5 for YAW2SRV`_`DAMP is a good starting point._

_Bitmap of what log types to enable in dataflash. This values is made up of the sum of each of the log types you want to be saved on dataflash. On a PX4 or Pixhawk the large storage size of a microSD card means it is usually best just to enable all log types by setting this to 65535. On APM2 the smaller 4 MByte dataflash means you need to be more selective in your logging or you may run out of log space while flying (in which case it will wrap and overwrite the start of the log). The individual bits are ATTITUDE`_`FAST`=`1, ATTITUDE`_`MEDIUM`=`2, GPS`=`4, PerformanceMonitoring`=`8, ControlTuning`=`16, NavigationTuning`=`32, Mode`=`64, IMU`=`128, Commands`=`256, Battery`=`512, Compass`=`1024, TECS`=`2048, Camera`=`4096, RCandServo`=`8192, Sonar`=`16384, Arming`=`32768, LogWhenDisarmed`=`65536, FullLogsArmedOnly`=`65535, FullLogsWhenDisarmed`=`131071_

 * Units: centi-Degrees


=== RTL altitude (!ArduPlane:ALT_HOLD_RTL) ===

_Return to launch target altitude. This is the altitude the plane will aim for and loiter at when returning home. If this is negative (usually -1) then the plane will use the current altitude at the time of entering RTL. Note that when transiting to a Rally Point the alitude of the Rally Point is used instead of ALT`_`HOLD`_`RTL._
 * Units: centimeters


=== Minimum altitude for FBWB mode (!ArduPlane:ALT_HOLD_FBWCM) ===

=== Flap input channel (!ArduPlane:FLAP_IN_CHANNEL) ===

_An RC input channel to use for flaps control. If this is set to a RC channel number then that channel will be used for manual flaps control. When enabled, the percentage of flaps is taken as the percentage travel from the TRIM value of the channel to the MIN value of the channel. A value above the TRIM values will give inverse flaps (spoilers). This option needs to be enabled in conjunction with a FUNCTION setting on an output channel to one of the flap functions. When a FLAP`_`IN`_`CHANNEL is combined with auto-flaps the higher of the two flap percentages is taken. You must also enable a FLAPERON`_`OUTPUT flaperon mixer setting if using flaperons._


=== Flaperon output (!ArduPlane:FLAPERON_OUTPUT) ===

_Enable flaperon output in software. If enabled then the APM will provide software flaperon mixing on the FLAPERON1 and FLAPERON2 output channels specified using the FUNCTION on two auxillary channels. There are 4 different mixing modes available, which refer to the 4 ways the flap and aileron outputs can be mapped to the two flaperon servos. Note that you must not use flaperon output mixing with hardware pass-through of RC values, such as with channel 8 manual control on an APM1. So if you use an APM1 then set FLTMODE`_`CH to something other than 8 before you enable FLAPERON`_`OUTPUT. Please also see the MIXING`_`GAIN parameter for the output gain of the mixer.

 * Range: 0 100
 * Units: Percent


=== PX4IO override channel (!ArduPlane:OVERRIDE_CHAN) ===

_If set to a non-zero value then this is an RC input channel number to use for testing manual control in case the main FMU microcontroller on a PX4 or Pixhawk fails. When this RC input channel goes above 1750 the FMU will stop sending servo controls to the PX4IO board, which will trigger the PX4IO board to start using its failsafe override behaviour, which should give you manual control of the aircraft. That allows you to test for correct manual behaviour without actually crashing the FMU. This parameter is normally only set to a non-zero value for ground testing purposes. When the override channel is used it also forces the PX4 safety switch into an armed state. This allows it to be used as a way to re-arm a plane after an in-flight reboot. Use in that way is considered a developer option, for people testing unstable developer code. Note that you may set OVERRIDE`_`CHAN to the same channel as FLTMODE`_`CH to get PX4IO based override when in flight mode 6. Note that when override is triggered the 6 auxillary output channels on Pixhawk will no longer be updated, so all the flight controls you need must be assigned to the first 8 channels._

=== Damping Gain (RLL2SRV_D) ===

_This is the gain from roll rate to aileron. This adjusts the damping of the roll control loop. It has the same effect as RLL2SRV`_`D in the old PID controller but without the spikes in servo demands. This gain helps to reduce rolling in turbulence. It should be increased in 0.01 increments as too high a value can lead to a high frequency roll oscillation that could overstress the airframe._
 * Range: 0 0.1
 * Increment: 0.01


=== Integrator Gain (RLL2SRV_I) ===

_This is the gain from the integral of bank angle to aileron. It has the same effect as RLL2SRV`_`I in the old PID controller. Increasing this gain causes the controller to trim out steady offsets due to an out of trim aircraft._
 * Range: 0 1.0
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Maximum Roll Rate (RLL2SRV_RMAX) ===

_This sets the maximum roll rate that the controller will demand (degrees`/`sec). Setting it to zero disables the limit. If this value is set too low, then the roll can't keep up with the navigation demands and the plane will start weaving. If it is set too high (or disabled by setting to zero) then ailerons will get large inputs at the start of turns. A limit of 60 degrees`/`sec is a good default._
 * Range: 0 180
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: degrees`/`second


=== Integrator limit (RLL2SRV_IMAX) ===

_This limits the number of degrees of aileron in centi-degrees over which the integrator will operate. At the default setting of 3000 centi-degrees, the integrator will be limited to +- 30 degrees of servo travel. The maximum servo deflection is +- 45 centi-degrees, so the default value represents a 2`/`3rd of the total control throw which is adequate unless the aircraft is severely out of trim._
 * Range: 0 4500
 * Increment: 1


== PTCH2SRV_ Parameters ==


=== Pitch Time Constant (PTCH2SRV_TCONST) ===

_This controls the time constant in seconds from demanded to achieved pitch angle. A value of 0.5 is a good default and will work with nearly all models. Advanced users may want to reduce this time to obtain a faster response but there is no point setting a time less than the aircraft can achieve._
 * Range: 0.4 1.0
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: seconds


=== Proportional Gain (PTCH2SRV_P) ===

_This is the gain from pitch angle to elevator. This gain works the same way as PTCH2SRV`_`P in the old PID controller and can be set to the same value._
 * Range: 0.1 3.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Damping Gain (PTCH2SRV_D) ===

_This is the gain from pitch rate to elevator. This adjusts the damping of the pitch control loop. It has the same effect as PTCH2SRV`_`D in the old PID controller and can be set to the same value, but without the spikes in servo demands. This gain helps to reduce pitching in turbulence. Some airframes such as flying wings that have poor pitch damping can benefit from increasing this gain term. This should be increased in 0.01 increments as too high a value can lead to a high frequency pitch oscillation that could overstress the airframe._
 * Range: 0 0.1
 * Increment: 0.01


=== Integrator Gain (PTCH2SRV_I) ===

_This is the gain applied to the integral of pitch angle. It has the same effect as PTCH2SRV`_`I in the old PID controller and can be set to the same value. Increasing this gain causes the controller to trim out constant offsets between demanded and measured pitch angle._
 * Range: 0 0.5
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Pitch up max rate (PTCH2SRV_RMAX_UP) ===

_This sets the maximum nose up pitch rate that the controller will demand (degrees`/`sec). Setting it to zero disables the limit._
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: degrees`/`second


=== Pitch down max rate (PTCH2SRV_RMAX_DN) ===

_This sets the maximum nose down pitch rate that the controller will demand (degrees`/`sec). Setting it to zero disables the limit._
 * Range: 0 100
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: degrees`/`second


=== Roll compensation (PTCH2SRV_RLL) ===

_This is the gain term that is applied to the pitch rate offset calculated as required to keep the nose level during turns. The default value is 1 which will work for all models. Advanced users can use it to correct for height variation in turns. If height is lost initially in turns this can be increased in small increments of 0.05 to compensate. If height is gained initially in turns then it can be decreased._
 * Range: 0.7 1.5
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Integrator limit (PTCH2SRV_IMAX) ===

_This limits the number of centi-degrees of elevator over which the integrator will operate. At the default setting of 3000 centi-degrees, the integrator will be limited to +- 30 degrees of servo travel. The maximum servo deflection is +- 45 degrees, so the default value represents a 2`/`3rd of the total control throw which is adequate for most aircraft unless they are severely out of trim or have very limited elevator control effectiveness._
 * Range: 0 4500
 * Increment: 1


== YAW2SRV_ Parameters ==


=== Sideslip control gain (YAW2SRV_SLIP) ===

_This is the gain from measured lateral acceleration to demanded yaw rate. It should be set to zero unless active control of sideslip is desired. This will only work effectively if there is enough fuselage side area to generate a measureable lateral acceleration when the model sideslips. Flying wings and most gliders cannot use this term. This term should only be adjusted after the basic yaw damper gain YAW2SRV`_`DAMP is tuned and the YAW2SRV`_`INT integrator gain has been set. Set this gain to zero if only yaw damping is required._
 * Range: 0 4
 * Increment: 0.25


=== Sidelsip control integrator (YAW2SRV_INT) ===

_This is the integral gain from lateral acceleration error. This gain should only be non-zero if active control over sideslip is desired. If active control over sideslip is required then this can be set to 1.0 as a first try._
 * Range: 0 2
 * Increment: 0.25


=== Yaw damping (YAW2SRV_DAMP) ===

_This is the gain from yaw rate to rudder. It acts as a damper on yaw motion. If a basic yaw damper is required, this gain term can be incremented, whilst leaving the YAW2SRV`_`SLIP and YAW2SRV`_`INT gains at zero. Note that unlike with a standard PID controller, if this damping term is zero then the integrator will also be disabled._
 * Range: 0 2
 * Increment: 0.25


=== Yaw coordination gain (YAW2SRV_RLL) ===

_This is the gain term that is applied to the yaw rate offset calculated as required to keep the yaw rate consistent with the turn rate for a coordinated turn. The default value is 1 which will work for all models. Advanced users can use it to correct for any tendency to yaw away from or into the turn once the turn is established. Increase to make the model yaw more initially and decrease to make the model yaw less initially. If values greater than 1.1 or less than 0.9 are required then it normally indicates a problem with the airspeed calibration._
 * Range: 0.8 1.2
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Integrator limit (YAW2SRV_IMAX) ===

_This limits the number of centi-degrees of rudder over which the integrator will operate. At the default setting of 1500 centi-degrees, the integrator will be limited to +- 15 degrees of servo travel. The maximum servo deflection is +- 45 degrees, so the default value represents a 1`/`3rd of the total control throw which is adequate for most aircraft unless they are severely out of trim or have very limited rudder control effectiveness._
 * Range: 0 4500
 * Increment: 1


== STEER2SRV_ Parameters ==


=== Steering Time Constant (STEER2SRV_TCONST) ===

_This controls the time constant in seconds from demanded to achieved steering angle. A value of 0.75 is a good default and will work with nearly all rovers. Ground steering in aircraft needs a bit smaller time constant, and a value of 0.5 is recommended for best ground handling in fixed wing aircraft. A value of 0.75 means that the controller will try to correct any deviation between the desired and actual steering angle in 0.75 seconds. Advanced users may want to reduce this time to obtain a faster response but there is no point setting a time less than the vehicle can achieve._
 * Range: 0.4 1.0
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: seconds


=== Steering turning gain (STEER2SRV_P) ===

_The proportional gain for steering. This should be approximately equal to the diameter of the turning circle of the vehicle at low speed and maximum steering angle_
 * Range: 0.1 10.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Integrator Gain (STEER2SRV_I) ===

_This is the gain from the integral of steering angle. Increasing this gain causes the controller to trim out steady offsets due to an out of trim vehicle._
 * Range: 0 1.0
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Damping Gain (STEER2SRV_D) ===

_This adjusts the damping of the steering control loop. This gain helps to reduce steering jitter with vibration. It should be increased in 0.01 increments as too high a value can lead to a high frequency steering oscillation that could overstress the vehicle._
 * Range: 0 0.1
 * Increment: 0.01


=== Integrator limit (STEER2SRV_IMAX) ===

_This limits the number of degrees of steering in centi-degrees over which the integrator will operate. At the default setting of 1500 centi-degrees, the integrator will be limited to +- 15 degrees of servo travel. The maximum servo deflection is +- 45 centi-degrees, so the default value represents a 1`/`3rd of the total control throw which is adequate unless the vehicle is severely out of trim._
 * Range: 0 4500
 * Increment: 1


=== Minimum speed (STEER2SRV_MINSPD) ===

_This is the minimum assumed ground speed in meters`/`second for steering. Having a minimum speed prevents oscillations when the vehicle first starts moving. The vehicle can still driver slower than this limit, but the steering calculations will be done based on this minimum speed._
 * Range: 0 5
 * Increment: 0.1
 * Units: m`/`s

=== Compass orientation (COMPASS_ORIENT) ===

_The orientation of the compass relative to the autopilot board. This will default to the right value for each board type, but can be changed if you have an external compass. See the documentation for your external compass for the right value. The correct orientation should give the X axis forward, the Y axis to the right and the Z axis down. So if your aircraft is pointing west it should show a positive value for the Y axis, and a value close to zero for the X axis. On a PX4 or Pixhawk with an external compass the correct value is zero if the compass is correctly oriented. NOTE: This orientation is combined with any AHRS`_`ORIENTATION setting._

=== Automatic airspeed ratio calibration (ARSPD_AUTOCAL) ===

_If this is enabled then the APM will automatically adjust the ARSPD`_`RATIO during flight, based upon an estimation filter using ground speed and true airspeed. The automatic calibration will save the new ratio to EEPROM every 2 minutes if it changes by more than 5%. This option should be enabled for a calibration flight then disabled again when calibration is complete. Leaving it enabled all the time is not recommended._


=== Control pitot tube order (ARSPD_TUBE_ORDER) ===

_This parameter allows you to control whether the order in which the tubes are attached to your pitot tube matters. If you set this to 0 then the top connector on the sensor needs to be the dynamic pressure. If set to 1 then the bottom connector needs to be the dynamic pressure. If set to 2 (the default) then the airspeed driver will accept either order. The reason you may wish to specify the order is it will allow your airspeed sensor to detect if the aircraft it receiving excessive pressure on the static port, which would otherwise be seen as a positive airspeed._


=== Skip airspeed calibration on startup (ARSPD_SKIP_CAL) ===

_This parameter allows you to skip airspeed offset calibration on startup, instead using the offset from the last calibration. This may be desirable if the offset variance between flights for your sensor is low and you want to avoid having to cover the pitot tube on each boot._

|| 1 || Enable ||


== NAVL1_ Parameters ==


=== L1 control period (NAVL1_PERIOD) ===

_Period in seconds of L1 tracking loop. This parameter is the primary control for agressiveness of turns in auto mode. This needs to be larger for less responsive airframes. The default of 20 is quite conservative, but for most RC aircraft will lead to reasonable flight. For smaller more agile aircraft a value closer to 15 is appropriate, or even as low as 10 for some very agile aircraft. When tuning, change this value in small increments, as a value that is much too small (say 5 or 10 below the right value) can lead to very radical turns, and a risk of stalling._
 * Range: 1-60
 * Increment: 1
 * Units: seconds


=== L1 control damping ratio (NAVL1_DAMPING) ===

_Damping ratio for L1 control. Increase this in increments of 0.05 if you are getting overshoot in path tracking. You should not need a value below 0.7 or above 0.85._
 * Range: 0.6-1.0
 * Increment: 0.05


== TECS_ Parameters ==


=== Maximum Climb Rate (metres/sec) (TECS_CLMB_MAX) ===

_This is the best climb rate that the aircraft can achieve with the throttle set to THR`_`MAX and the airspeed set to the default value. For electric aircraft make sure this number can be achieved towards the end of flight when the battery voltage has reduced. The setting of this parameter can be checked by commanding a positive altitude change of 100m in loiter, RTL or guided mode. If the throttle required to climb is close to THR`_`MAX and the aircraft is maintaining airspeed, then this parameter is set correctly. If the airspeed starts to reduce, then the parameter is set to high, and if the throttle demand require to climb and maintain speed is noticeably less than THR`_`MAX, then either CLMB`_`MAX should be increased or THR`_`MAX reduced._
 * Range: 0.1 20.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Minimum Sink Rate (metres/sec) (TECS_SINK_MIN) ===

_This is the sink rate of the aircraft with the throttle set to THR`_`MIN and the same airspeed as used to measure CLMB`_`MAX._
 * Range: 0.1 10.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Controller time constant (sec) (TECS_TIME_CONST) ===

_This is the damping gain for the throttle demand loop. Increase to add damping  to correct for oscillations in speed and height._
 * Range: 0.1 1.0

 * Range: 0.0 0.5
 * Increment: 0.02


=== Vertical Acceleration Limit (metres/sec^2) (TECS_VERT_ACC) ===

_This is the maximum vertical acceleration either up or down that the  controller will use to correct speed or height errors._
 * Range: 1.0 10.0
 * Increment: 0.5


=== Height complementary filter frequency (radians/sec) (TECS_HGT_OMEGA) ===

_This is the cross-over frequency of the complementary filter used to fuse vertical acceleration and baro alt to obtain an estimate of height rate and height._
 * Range: 1.0 5.0
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Speed complementary filter frequency (radians/sec) (TECS_SPD_OMEGA) ===

_This is the cross-over frequency of the complementary filter used to fuse longitudinal acceleration and airspeed to obtain a lower noise and lag estimate of airspeed._
 * Range: 0.5 2.0
 * Increment: 0.05


=== Bank angle compensation gain (TECS_RLL2THR) ===

_Increasing this gain turn increases the amount of throttle that will be used to compensate for the additional drag created by turning. Ideally this should be set to approximately 10 x the extra sink rate in m`/`s created by a 45 degree bank turn. Increase this gain if the aircraft initially loses energy in turns and reduce if the aircraft initially gains energy in turns. Efficient high aspect-ratio aircraft (eg powered sailplanes) can use a lower value, whereas inefficient low aspect-ratio models (eg delta wings) can use a higher value._
 * Range: 5.0 30.0
 * Increment: 1.0


=== Weighting applied to speed control (TECS_SPDWEIGHT) ===

_This parameter adjusts the amount of weighting that the pitch control applies to speed vs height errors. Setting it to 0.0 will cause the pitch control to control height and ignore speed errors. This will normally improve height accuracy but give larger airspeed errors. Setting it to 2.0 will cause the pitch control loop to control speed and ignore height errors. This will normally reduce airsped errors, but give larger height errors.	A value of 1.0 gives a balanced response and is the default._
 * Range: 0.0 2.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Controller pitch damping (TECS_PTCH_DAMP) ===

_This is the damping gain for the pitch demand loop. Increase to add damping  to correct for oscillations in speed and height._
 * Range: 0.1 1.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Maximum Descent Rate (metres/sec) (TECS_SINK_MAX) ===

_This sets the maximum descent rate that the controller will use.  If this value is too large, the aircraft will reach the pitch angle limit first and be unable to achieve the descent rate. This should be set to a value that can be achieved at the lower pitch angle limit._
 * Range: 0.0 20.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Airspeed during landing approach (m/s) (TECS_LAND_ARSPD) ===

_When performing an autonomus landing, this value is used as the goal airspeed during approach.  Note that this parameter is not useful if your platform does not have an airspeed sensor (use TECS`_`LAND`_`THR instead).  If negative then this value is not used during landing._
 * Range: -1 127
 * Increment: 1


=== Cruise throttle during landing approach (percentage) (TECS_LAND_THR) ===

_Use this parameter instead of LAND`_`ASPD if your platform does not have an airspeed sensor.  It is the cruise throttle during landing approach.  If it is negative if TECS`_`LAND`_`ASPD is in use then this value is not used during landing._
 * Range: -1 to 100
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Weighting applied to speed control during landing. (TECS_LAND_SPDWGT) ===

_Same as SPDWEIGHT parameter, with the exception that this parameter is applied during landing flight stages.  A value closer to 2 will result in the plane ignoring height error during landing and our experience has been that the plane will therefore keep the nose up -- sometimes good for a glider landing (with the side effect that you will likely glide a ways past the landing point).  A value closer to 0 results in the plane ignoring speed error -- use caution when lowering the value below 1 -- ignoring speed could result in a stall._
 * Range: 0.0 2.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Maximum pitch in auto flight (TECS_PITCH_MAX) ===

_This controls maximum pitch up in automatic throttle modes. If this is set to zero then LIM`_`PITCH`_`MAX is used instead. The purpose of this parameter is to allow the use of a smaller pitch range when in automatic flight than what is used in FBWA mode._
 * Range: 0 45
 * Increment: 1


=== Minimum pitch in auto flight (TECS_PITCH_MIN) ===

_This controls minimum pitch in automatic throttle modes. If this is set to zero then LIM`_`PITCH`_`MIN is used instead. The purpose of this parameter is to allow the use of a smaller pitch range when in automatic flight than what is used in FBWA mode. Note that TECS`_`PITCH`_`MIN should be a negative number._
 * Range: -45 0
 * Increment: 1


=== Sink rate for final landing stage (TECS_LAND_SINK) ===

_The sink rate in meters`/`second for the final stage of landing._
 * Range: 0.0 2.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Land controller time constant (sec) (TECS_LAND_TCONST) ===

_This is the time constant of the TECS control algorithm when in final landing stage of flight. It should be smaller than TECS`_`TIME`_`CONST to allow for faster flare_
 * Range: 1.0 5.0
 * Increment: 0.2


=== Controller sink rate to pitch gain during flare (TECS_LAND_DAMP) ===

_This is the sink rate gain for the pitch demand loop when in final landing stage of flight. It should be larger than TECS`_`PTCH`_`DAMP to allow for better sink rate control during flare._
 * Range: 0.1 1.0
 * Increment: 0.1


=== Maximum pitch during final stage of landing (TECS_LAND_PMAX) ===

_This limits the pitch used during the final stage of automatic landing. During the final landing stage most planes need to keep their pitch small to avoid stalling. A maximum of 10 degrees is usually good. A value of zero means to use the normal pitch limits._
